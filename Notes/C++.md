- definition int x{1};
- constants constexpr int x{1}; like  `#define`
- constants constinit int x{1}; ensuring that the initialization of the variable happens during the static initialization phase, preventing potential issues with initialization order or delayed initialization.
- function overloading
- if constexpr
- if and switch with initializer
- size_t in loops
- Range Based For Loop with initializer
