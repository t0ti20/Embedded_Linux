this is most common guides tell you how to write cpp clean code
```cpp
#Variable should be initialized <{}>
uint32_t Variable{};
#Variable Decleration by Fixed width <uint32_t>
uint32_t Variable{};
#Code Should Be Clean From Magic Numbers
constexpr uint32_t Number{10};
#Loops Sould Be Use size_t
for(size_t Counter{};Counter<10;++Counter){};

#Variable should be initialized
uint32_t Variable{};
#Variable should be initialized
uint32_t Variable{};
```
