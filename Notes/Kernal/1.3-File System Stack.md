When a user wants to store any data, Linux utilizes a file system stack, centrally featuring the Virtual File System (VFS). This VFS provides a bridge, allowing applications to communicate seamlessly with various underlying file systems.

#### **Virtual File System (VFS)**
- **Role**: Sits between the system's applications and actual file systems, offering a standardized interface.

#### **Advantages of VFS**:
- **Abstract Layer**: Allows for abstracting different implementations of file systems, making it simpler for applications.
- **Standardization**: Gives a uniform interface to the kernel while catering to different file system types.
- **Flexibility**: Provides file operations on non-regular files such as device nodes and named pipes.
- **File System Neutral**: Assists in operations like mounting and translating between diverse file systems.

#### **Types of File Systems**:
- **EXT4**: A journaling file system ensuring data reliability and quick recovery post system crashes.
- **RAM File System (tmpfs)**: Stores items in volatile memory, offering speed but not persistence after reboots.
- **Network File System (NFS)**: Facilitates sharing files and directories over networks, rendering them as locally mounted.

#### **Essential Commands**:
- **Viewing Content**:
    - `lsblk`: List block devices.
    - `tree`: Display directory content as a tree structure.
    - `head`: Show the beginning of files.
    - `cat`: Display and concatenate file contents.
    - `file`: Determine file types.
    - `stat`: Offer file and filesystem details.
- **Manipulation**:
    - `fdisk`: Disk manipulation utility.
    - `gparted`: GUI-based partition editor.
    - `mount`: Attach a filesystem to the directory tree.
    - `cd`: Change directories.
    - `cp`: Copy files/directories.
    - `mv`: Move or rename files/directories.
    - `mkdir`: Create directories.
    - `touch`: Create files.
- **Diagnostics**:
    - `dmesg`: Access kernel ring buffer, crucial for diagnosing issues.
    - `lsusb`: Display USB device details.

#### **Filesystem Components**:
- **/etc/fstab**: Configuration containing all partition and storage device details, automounting them during startup.
- **/dev**: Houses device nodes, signifying device files.
- **/mnt and /media**: Traditional and modern directories for mounting filesystems, respectively.

#### **Additional Concepts**:
- **Inodes**: Store info about files and directories (barring data).
- **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**: Dictates the directory structure and content in Linux distributions.
- **/proc filesystem**: A virtual filesystem to access kernel structures.
- **Permissions and Ownership**: Incorporate users, groups, and file permissions.
