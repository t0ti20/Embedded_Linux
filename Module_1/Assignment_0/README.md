# ðŸš€ Kernel Module Exploration: M1-S2-A0 ðŸš€

Welcome to the first assignment in our kernel module exploration! Dive into the world of processes, priorities, and cores. Ready to get started?

## ðŸŽ¯ Tasks

### 1. ðŸ§® **Discover Your Cores**:
   - Fire up the terminal and use the `top` command. Can you find out how many cores your machine is running on?

### 2. ðŸ”„ **Spinning Processes**:
   - Let's create some processes! But not just any number. Calculate the number of cores you have and add two. That's the number of `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null` processes you need to run in the background. Can you handle the challenge?

### 3. ðŸŽš **Shuffling Priorities**:
   - It's time to juggle! Change the priority of the processes you just created. Start from `-20`, and increment by 10 until you reach `0`, then increment by one all the way to `19`.

### 4. ðŸ–¥ **Monitor the Madness**:
   - Go back to the `top` command and keep a watchful eye on the processes. Spot any differences? Record what you observe!

### 5. ðŸš« **Enough Chaos! Stop the Processes**:
   - Let's wind down. Use the `killall` command to stop all the processes you started.

## ðŸ“¤ What to Submit

- **Command Chronicle**: Create a file documenting all the commands you've used throughout this exercise.
  
- **Visual Evidence (Optional)**: If you're feeling fancy, take some screenshots of your process. It's always great to have a visual trail!
