Ownership and resources Managements.


## Exercise 1: File Permissions and Ownership

1. Create a directory called access_practice.
2. Inside the directory, create a file named secret.txt.
3. Set the file permissions to allow read and write access for the owner, and no access for group and others.
4. Change the ownership of the file to a different user.
5. Try accessing the file from the original and the different user accounts to observe the access permissions in action.



## Exercise 2: User and Group Management

1. Create a new user named user1.
2. Create a new group named group1.
3. Add user1 to group1.
4. Change the ownership of secret.txt to user1 and group1.
5. Set the file permissions to allow read and write access for the owner and the group.
6. Test accessing the file both as user1 and a different user to understand group-based access control.
